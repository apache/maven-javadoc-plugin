# javadoc has some annoying bugs that make the output unreproducible:
# See: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MJAVADOC-681
# https://bugs.openjdk.org/browse/JDK-8268771
# https://bugs.openjdk.org/browse/JDK-8237909

# To create "reproducible" javadoc you need to use Java 8 or Java 15+
invoker.java.version = 1.8, 15+
invoker.goals = compile javadoc:jar
